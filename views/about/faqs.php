                    <p>Members get immediate savings of 5% on any treatment they sign up for themselves or any family member or friend they refer. Simply, an average treatment cost through Meddistant is about $4000 or more. Thus, as a member, your membership pays for itself with one treatment only (5% of $4000 = $200 while membership fee is a little less). Why would we do such a thing, well it is lower advertising cost for us, plus we would rather pay you the customer instead of paying Google or Facebook.</p>
