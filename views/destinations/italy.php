              <p>The Italian Hospitals have won the “Gold Seal of Quality” awarded by JCI. The Commission has certified safety standards and quality care in 368 areas. The patients can get quality treatment for cardiac surgery, orthopedics, neurology, oncology, etc.</p>
              <p>The medical treatment cost offered in Italy is quite competitive as compared to other countries. Moreover, it’s a Mediterranean nation with a great image, environment, and standard accreditations. Are you looking forward to affordable and qualitative surgery in Turkey or Mexico or Italy?

              <p>Italy’s healthcare system is regionally organized and provides universal healthcare coverage to all citizens and legal residents via a mix of public and private systems. Anyone can opt to use the private system for specialized doctors and diagnostic tests to avoid wait times, but will have to pay out of pocket, as it will not be covered by the national health service (SSN). Also, if prescribed by doctors, medicines are generally subsidized, like in many other destinations in the European Union.</p>
