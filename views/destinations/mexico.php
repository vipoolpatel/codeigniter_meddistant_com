              <h5>Country Information</h5>
              <p>The country of Mexico most often conjures images of “our neighbor south of the boarder,” ancient Meso-American ruins, colonial Spanish towns, and popular beach resorts. However, it may not be as widely known that it has been among the fastest growing economies in the world since the late 1990’s. This economic success has dramatically increased the quality of health care throughout the country that has led to the growing popularity of medical tourism.</p>
