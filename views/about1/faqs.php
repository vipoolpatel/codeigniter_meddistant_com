											<h3>What makes Meddistant different?</h3>
											
											<p>Meddistant is dedicated to offering customers transparent choices that
											deliver high quality medical services in the most efficient and cost-effective
											way to the customer. In most cases medical treatment through our facilitation
											process offer customers 50% or more savings over traditional cost in the US without 
											sacrificing quality of care. Those savings are achieved even when travel and accommodation expenses are included.</p>
											
											<h3>Does Meddistant protect my privacy?</h3>
											
											<p>Meddistant values customers privacy and will never sell data to any third party. We will only share your data with potential service providers for treatment purposes requested. Also, bidders for your treatment will only know your full information after you accept them to provide you with treatment.</p>
											
											
											<h3>Have all sevice provider been vetted and verified by Meddistant?</h3>
											
											<p>Meddistant verifies that all facilities that register as providers are vetted for meeting high quality standards set by International ISO and USA based JCI organization.  </p>
											
										<h3>
										  What fees does Meddistant charge?
										</h3>
											
										<p>
										The customer is not charged any additional fees. Meddistant has agreements with service providers who pay Meddistant fees for facilitation.
										</p>
										
										<h3>
Would my insurance or employer funded plan cover treatment?										</h3>
											
										<p>
In some cases, insurance or an employer funded plan may cover the procedure. After the customer chooses a service provider for treatment, he or she may want to check with their plan for coverage before committing to the trip to destination. 										</p>
										
										<h3>
What treatments are offered through Meddistant?										</h3>
											
										<p>
Meddistant has no limitation on type of treatment a customer may request. Customers may request treatment for cosmetic or medical conditions that meets their needs.										</p>
										
										<h3>
What if I have complications after treatment?										</h3>
											
										<p>
Each of the facilities we work with will cover any complications after treatment for a period of six months. In some cases, this may not be feasible as they will not cover travel expenses that may be prohibitive. Meddistant recommend that customer buys additional insurance provided under financing that covers any after treatment complications for a period of six months.										</p>
										
										<h3>
What if I donâ€™t get any competitive quotes for my treatment?										</h3>
											
										<p>
Please make sure you select the correct category that corresponds with your treatment. Include all pertinent information and medical files that helps physicians evaluate your situation. If you need help at any time, please contact us: support@meddistant.com or call us at 888.969-9959 or 1312-889-9105.
										</p>
										
										<h2>
What are the benefits of membership?										</h2>
											
										<p>
Members get immediate savings of 5% on any treatment they sign up for themselves or any family member or friend they refer. Simply, an average treatment cost through Meddistant is about $4000 or more. Thus, as a member, your membership pays for itself with one treatment only (5% of $4000 = $200 while membership fee is a little less). Why would we do such a thing, well it is lower advertising cost for us, plus we would rather pay you the customer instead of paying Google or Facebook.										</p>
