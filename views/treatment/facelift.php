             <h3>Facelift</h3>

             <p class="text-gray-base size-17">Surgery will target sagging cheeks, jowls, fine lines and facial creases as well as reduce loose skin and excess fatty deposits along the face and neck. The result is firmer skin that helps you appear younger.</p>

              <p>It’s natural to want to look good as you age. Some of the first signs of aging appear on the face and neck, which may cause you to feel self-conscious about the way you look. Although aging is an inevitable process, it’s not impossible to slow down its effects on your skin. Wrinkles and volume loss can both become a problem, resulting in skin laxity and sunken features, but you have several options to consider when it comes to facial rejuvenation.</p>
              <p>Meddistant can help find the right surgeon and facility that exactly fits your needs. Our network of hospitals and clinics around the world hold to the quality standards set by ISO and JCI assurance organizations.</p>

              <h5>What does a facelift correct?</h5>
              <p>Your facelift will focus on the areas that have become prone to aging. This may include volume loss in the cheeks, creases around the eyelids, nose and mouth, skin laxity around the lower portions of the face and neck, fat loss and more. Additionally, several surgical procedures can be performed in conjunction with your facelift, depending on the cosmetic concerns you are experiencing. A brow lift, for example, can reduce sagging skin while eyelid surgery can recreate youthful qualities around the eyes. Fat grafting is also used to restore a youthful shape to the face and as a more natural alternative to injectable fillers.</p>
              <p>To determine whether a facelift is right for you, you will come in for a consultation where Dr Hobson can evaluate the tone and texture of your skin. The goal of any facelift procedure should be to produce an aesthetic effect that maintains your original beauty. While a facelift will create a more dramatic effect than what you would receive with injectable fillers, for instance, surgical results that look overworked are not considered proper enhancements.</p>

              <h5>The right incision for you</h5>
              <p>During surgery, one of several incisions may be used based on the aesthetic results you would like to achieve. Traditionally, procedures start with an incision along the hairline and around the ear, but limited incisions are also useful when a lesser degree of rejuvenation is required. Many patients also experience sagging skin around the neck, which is easily corrected in combination with facelift surgery.</p>
              <p>As you recover, you will also come in for follow-up appointments to check on the progress of your facelift. The physician will provide you with information that may expedite the healing process. A facelift may take several weeks to heal fully, but your patience is worth the beautiful results you will receive in return. Not only will your skin appear fresh and more youthful, but also your self-confidence will be restored.</p>
