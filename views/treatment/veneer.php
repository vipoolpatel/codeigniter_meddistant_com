             <h3>Veneers</h3>

             <p class="text-gray-base size-17">Dental veneers (sometimes called porcelain veneers or dental porcelain laminates) are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve your appearance. These shells are bonded to the front of the teeth changing their color, shape, size, or length.</p>

              <p>Embed Asset Override Dental veneers can be made from porcelain or from resin composite materials. Porcelain veneers resist stains better than resin veneers and better mimic the light reflecting properties of natural teeth. You will need to discuss the best choice of veneer material for you with your dentist.</p>
              <h5>What are veneers?</h5>
			  <p>Dental veneers are thin, tooth-colored shells that are attached to the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance. Theyâ€™re often made from porcelain or resin-composite materials and are permanently bonded to your teeth.</p>
			  <p>Veneers can be used to treat a number of different cosmetic concerns, including chipped, broken, discolored, or smaller-than-average teeth.</p>
			  <p>Some people may only get one veneer in the case of a broken or chipped tooth, but many get between six to eight veneers in order to create an even, symmetrical smile. The top front eight teeth are the most commonly applied veneers.</p>

              <h5>Advantages over Other Procedures</h5>
              <p class="text-gray-base">Veneers are stain resistant and last for years at a time. When patients choose teeth whitening treatment, they often receive less dramatic results and must undergo touchup treatments approximately twice a year.</p>
			  <p class="text-gray-base">Veneers look more lifelike than similar enhancements. Cosmetic dental bonding can correct similar flaws, but the material is opaque, meaning it does not reflect light the way porcelain does.</p>
			  <p class="text-gray-base">Although veneers typically cost more than bonding or teeth whitening, they usually have a smaller price tag than dental crowns.</p>

              <h5>Increased Confidence and Happiness</h5>
              <p class="text-gray-base">One of the biggest advantages of porcelain veneers is the effect they can have on a patient's self-assurance and emotional wellness. When patients feel good about the appearance of their teeth, they are more likely to smile. In turn, this can increase their mood, social life, and even professional success.</p>

              <h5>Oral Health Benefits</h5>
              <p class="text-gray-base">The primary benefits of veneers are cosmetic; however, there are several ways that they can boost overall dental health. First, they can lend some strength to damaged teeth. Patients should note, however, that veneers cannot restore a severely damaged or weakened tooth. In these cases, a dental crown will provide better protection for a patient's oral health.</p>
