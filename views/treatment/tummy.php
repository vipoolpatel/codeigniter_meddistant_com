             <h3>Tummy tucks</h3>

             <p class="text-gray-base size-17">Aging, weight loss, and childbirth can all contribute to sagging skin around the abdomen, which may make you feel out of shape or unattractive. Additionally, diet and exercise rarely correct skin laxity on their own. Thatâ€™s why many patients resort to tummy tuck surgery to tighten the skin, reduce excess fat and tighten abdominal muscles.</p>

              <p>Reasons for a Tummy Tuck (abdominoplasty) are many.  One common reason is weight loss.  You may have weighed more at some point in your life but you learned how to eat right and lost weight.  The resulting sagging skin left over from dramatic weight loss can be removed.</p>
              <p>A Tummy Tuck procedure can help you accomplish many of the aesthetic benefits that you may not be able to achieve without surgery. Although you may eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly, excess skin and fat can line the abdominal region and interfere with your abs and ruin your work to define your midsection you have been working hard to achieve.</p>
              <p>Being help back from your goal is no fun. At Meddistant, we help you find an abdominoplasty procedure that fits your exact needs without breaking the bank. Rest assured, our high-quality network of hospitals and clinics around the world are quality standards set by ISO, International Standards Organization and JCI, Joint Commission International assurance organizations and met by our hospitals members.</p>

              <h5>Your candidacy for tummy tuck surgery</h5>
			         <p class="text-gray-base">A tummy tuck is the best route if you have been unable to eliminate excess skin and fat from diet and exercise alone. You may have recently lost a significant amount of weight, experienced skin damaged by natural aging, or gone through one or more pregnancies that have left your abdominal region with stretched skin and weakened muscles.</p>

  				<h5>Uncovering the results of your abdominoplasty</h5>
  				<p class="text-gray-base">An abdominoplasty does require some downtime before anticipated results start to show. You will have limited mobility for the first few days, and we encourage you to minimize your activity for one or two weeks after surgery.</p>
  				<p class="text-gray-base">Certified doctors will make sure that you have a thorough understanding of your recovery instructions once the healing process begins. Directions may include specific care for surgical drains, dosages for oral medications and best practices for preventing infection. You will also come in for follow-up appointments where we can assess the progress of your recovery and make any suggestions for quicker healing.</p>
  				<p class="text-gray-base">Because every individual receives surgery based on specific need, the time it takes to recover fully varies from person to person. You will also notice at this time that your profile looks and feels slimmer.</p
