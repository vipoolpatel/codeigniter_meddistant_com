             <h3>IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF)</h3>

             <p class="text-gray-base size-17">
              Becoming a parent is precious and science has provided a way to overcome natural obstacles.</p>
              <p class="text-gray-base size-17"> In vitro fertilization is a medical procedure, where eggs produced by ovaries are collected by a special procedure. One or several eggs are fertilized with sperm of the male under laboratory conditions.  After a short period of fertilization, the fertilized embryo is then transferred to the female uterus. The fertilized eggs (embryos) are placed into the womb of the mother in 2 to 5 days.</p>

        <h6>Reasons of Infertility</h6>

         <p>Based on various studies, the male factors account for 25-40% of all cases, and female factors account for 40-55%. There many possible root causes such for infertility as medical conditions, genetic or trauma.</p>

         <h6>A good candidate for the procedure</h6>
         <ul style="list-style: disc;padding: revert;margin-top: 10px;">
            <li>Patients with occluded or removed Fallopian Tubes,</li>
            <li>Patients diagnosed with endometriosis or who cannot conceive with surgeries,</li>
            <li>Patients who do not respond to medical treatment,</li>
            <li>Patients with idiopathic infertility,</li>
            <li>Patients with low or no sperm count in semen.</li>
         </ul>

          <h6>Stages of the in vitro fertilization</h6>

      <p class="text-gray-base">The age, ovarian reserve, blood hormone levels and height/weight ratio are considered to determine an appropriate treatment schedule and the dose of medication for patients who will receive in vitro fertilization therapy. In most cases, the IVF procedure is completed within two weeks.</p>
         <h6>Success Rates</h6>
         <p class="text-gray-base">The success rate of the in vitro fertilization is based on many factors, including but not limited to ovarian reserve, age and male factor. For women under 35 years old with a good ovarian reserve have success rates of about 60%, while the figure is around 30% for women older than 40, due to the high rate of genetic anomaly in this age group, Other techniques may be considered to improve the odds.</p>
