                 <h5>How Eyelids Work</h5>
                  <p>An eyelid is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects an eye. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle retracts the eyelid, exposing the cornea to the outside, giving vision. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily.</p>

              <p>Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink, your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye. You close your eyelids when you see something coming toward your eyes. This can help protect against injuries.</p>
              <p>Like most other parts of your body, your eyelids can get infected, inflamed, or even develop cancer.</p>

              <h5>What Is Cosmetic Blepharoplasty?</h5>
              <p>Cosmetic eyelid surgery is a surgical procedure that is not medically necessary and is performed solely to improve your appearance.  Unfortunately, your upper and sometimes lower eyelids may become droopy or baggy as part of the aging process. Your eyebrows also may sag or droop as a part of the same process.</p>
              <p>The eyelid skin stretches, muscles weaken and fat pockets become more prominent as they bulge. This may be a hereditary condition that runs in your family.</p>

              <h5>When Is Functional Blepharoplasty Needed?</h5>
              <p>A functional blepharoplasty (in contrast to a cosmetic blepharoplasty) is eyelid surgery performed for medical reasons. In most cases, a functional eye lift is performed to remove loose skin from the upper eyelid if it droops low enough to impair your vision for driving or other visual tasks.</p>

              <h5>Eyelid enhancement</h5>
              <p>Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure performed to correct deformities and improve or modify the appearance of the eyelids.[9] With 1.43 million people undergoing the procedure in 2014,[10] blepharoplasty is the second most popular cosmetic procedure in the world (Botulinum toxin injection is first), and the most frequently performed cosmetic surgical procedure in the world.</p>
              <p>Although an eyelid bump can be irritating, it is not usually harmful. Gently holding a warm compress against the eye can often help the lump to heal, and it should usually disappear within a few weeks</p>
              <p>If a person keeps getting a stye or chalazion, they may wish to seek medical advice. A doctor can arrange to take a tissue sample to check that there is no underlying eye problem.</p>
